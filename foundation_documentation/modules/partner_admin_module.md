# Documentation: Partner Admin & Workspace Module

**Version:** 0.1 (Placeholder)  
**Date:** February 28, 2025  
**Authors:** Delphi (Belluga Co-Engineering)

## 1. Purpose

Captures the intent to deliver a Partner Admin/Workspace experience where landlords and partners can manage invites, offers, media, and analytics. This module will be defined once the tenant-facing experience is fully specified so requirements flow from actual consumer workflows.

## 2. Planned Scope (to be detailed later)

1. **Invite Campaign Management:** Create/share invites, monitor quotas, handle suppression lists.
2. **Offer & Media Authoring:** CRUD for partner profiles, offers, availability windows, photo/video galleries.
3. **Task Inbox:** View/respond to user tasks (document requests, payment approvals, attendance confirmations).
4. **Analytics Dashboards:** Surface metrics from the Partner Analytics module (conversion funnels, attendance, plan usage).
5. **Notification Center:** Configure partner-side alerts (when quotas hit limits, when attendees check-in, etc.).

## 3. Next Action

Defer detailed documentation until the tenant modules (Map, Invite, Agenda, Transaction Bridge) stabilize. Partner admin requirements will be inferred directly from the data contracts and events defined there.
