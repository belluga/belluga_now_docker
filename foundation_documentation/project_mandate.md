## 2. Core Business Principles

These principles define the purpose and ethical boundaries of the platform. They are the foundational "Why" and guide all business and engineering decisions.

* **P-B1: Local Empowerment First:** We aim to improve local businesses, not to replace them. The platform's success is measured by the success of its partners.
* **P-B2: Additive Revenue Streams:** We want to give more streams of revenue to local businesses, not strip them from what they have or own their customer relationships exclusively.
* **P-B3: Authentic Connection:** The platform must foster genuine connections between people (moratoriums, tourists) and the local culture (specialists, producers), prioritizing authenticity over pure commoditization.
* **P-B4: Symbiotic Ecosystem:** The platform is not a zero-sum game. The relationship between users, partners, and the platform must be mutually beneficial.
