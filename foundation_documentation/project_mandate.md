## 1. Project Overview

* **Project Name:** "Bóora!"
* **Domain:** Multi-tenant Hyperlocal Experience Platform (TravelTech / Local Commerce)
* **High-Level Goal:** To establish a symbiotic digital ecosystem that connects residents, tourists, and local specialists (guides, artists, producers) through a multi-tenant platform for discovering and transacting local experiences, events, and products.

**Tenant framing:** Guar[APP]ari is the first tenant implementation hosted on Bóora!.

## 2. Core Business Principles

These principles define the purpose and ethical boundaries of the platform. They are the foundational "Why" and guide all business and engineering decisions.

* **P-B1: Local Empowerment First:** We aim to improve local businesses, not to replace them. The platform's success is measured by the success of its partners.
* **P-B2: Additive Revenue Streams:** We want to give more streams of revenue to local businesses, not strip them from what they have or own their customer relationships exclusively.
* **P-B3: Authentic Connection:** The platform must foster genuine connections between people (moratoriums, tourists) and the local culture (specialists, producers), prioritizing authenticity over pure commoditization.
* **P-B4: Symbiotic Ecosystem:** The platform is not a zero-sum game. The relationship between users, partners, and the platform must be mutually beneficial.
* **P-B5: Social Mobilization as North Star:** The definitive metric is real-world movement—`Convites Aceitos` + `Presenças Confirmadas`—tracked all-time and in the current month (“Em Alta”). Vanity metrics (followers, likes, stars) do not guide success.
* **P-B6: Privacy with Agency:** Users can operate publicly or limit visibility to reciprocated “amigos” while still participating in invites; rankings anonymize private profiles (blur/avatar masking).

## 3. Social Pivot Summary

*We are no longer just a city guide; we are a social engine for each tenant city.* Discovery exists to feed action. The home experience prioritizes pending invites and confirmed agenda over generic listings; partner/value is proven through mobilized presences, not star ratings. Every actor—users, Pro/Verificados, parceiros, curadores—shares the same profile substrate, with Pro/Verificado status unlocking monetization (spaces, apoiadores) and enhanced limits.
